        <p><a href="https://www.americanhumane.org"><b>The American Humane Association (AHA)</b></a>, founded in 1877, brings together leaders in the animal community to share ideas and information and support joint action on a range of issues important in animal welfare (Zawistowski 2008).  AHA offers an array of training courses in animal rescue, certification in euthanasia, humane education, and various other topics.  AHA also oversees the treatment of animals that appear in films and televisions.</p>
